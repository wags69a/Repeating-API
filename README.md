# Repeating-API
This script acts as a heartbeat to an API so it doesn't fall asleep.

#Installation 
I used python on my PC which had access to the customer's environment. You will have to adjust to your customer.

#Usage 
This code is meant to be used in a customer environment. It will change from each user. The URL should match what the customer gives you to test. All customer API keys and token were blanked out. The API that you ping can be anything. 

#DevNet 
Sandbox All sandboxes with APIs can use this script.

    Download python script based on the operating system you use to run the script.
    PIP install the requirements.
    Edit the file with your URL, key and token.
