# Repeating-API
This script acts as a heartbeat to an API so it doesn't fall asleep.

## Installation 
I used python on my PC which had access to the customer's environment. You will have to adjust to your customer.

## Usage 
This code was originally used in a customer environment. It will change with each user. The URL should match what the customer gives you to test. All customer API keys and token were blanked out. The API that you ping can be anything. The script will call the API over and over until you stop the script. The output is to the python terminal.

## DevNet 
Sandbox All sandboxes with APIs can use this script.

## Known issues 
There is no stop time for the script. Due to customer time, I have the script working and will add a stop time in version 2.

## Getting help 
Contact the owner if he is not too busy.

## Best Practice 
Run the script on 1 API to verify the script runs. Ramp up to 10,15 or 20 minutes when you know the script is working.

## Step by Step

    - Download python script based on the operating system you use to run the script.
    - PIP install the requirements.
    - Edit the file with your URL(Line 14), key(Line 18) and token(Line 19).
    - Run the script at the 1 minute setting. The script runs a minute after you start it.
    - Hit stop button in pycharm to stop, or equivalent in your app.
